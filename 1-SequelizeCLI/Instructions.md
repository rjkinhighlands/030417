# Sequelize CLI

In this activity we will use the Sequelize Command Line Interface to initialize a Sequelize project. 

## Instructions

* Utilize the Sequelize Quick Start Guide to initialize a Sequelize project and create and sync at least one model.

  * Once complete, run `node server` in the terminal. If you model was turned into a MySQL table, you were successful.
